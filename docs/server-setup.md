# Server Setup Script Documentation

## Dependencies

- `config/variable-loader.sh`
- `functions/input_utils.sh`
- `functions/ask_yes_no.sh`
- `functions/log_utils.sh`

## Error Handling

The `handle_error` function is defined in `functions/log_utils.sh` and logs the error message along with the line number where the error occurred, then exits the script with the same exit code.

## Backup Strategy

The `full_system_backup.sh` script backs up `/etc`, `/home`, `/root`, `/opt`, and the directories containing Docker and Kubernetes backups. It then creates a compressed archive and copies it to a remote server using `scp`. Local backups older than 14 days are deleted.

## Rollback Plan

[To be added - detailed steps to revert changes made by the script in case of failure]

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Lack of Test Environment:** The primary risk is that errors in the script could cause downtime or data loss in production. Mitigation: Thorough documentation, a detailed rollback plan, and careful monitoring during and after execution.
- **Backup Failure:** If the backup fails, data loss could occur. Mitigation: Verify backup server accessibility and storage space before running the script.
- **Dependency Issues:** If any of the required tools or scripts are missing or misconfigured, the script may fail. Mitigation: Double-check all dependencies before running the script.

## Execution Plan

- [ ] Verify the remote backup server is accessible and has sufficient storage space.
- [ ] Confirm the `REMOTE_USER` and `REMOTE_HOST` variables in `server-setup.sh` are correctly configured.
- [ ] Ensure the `docker_backup.sh` and `k8s_backup.sh` scripts are functional and up-to-date.
- [ ] Run the `server-setup.sh` script in production.
- [ ] Monitor the script's output closely for any errors.
- [ ] Verify that the backup was created successfully and copied to the remote server.
- [ ] Confirm that all services are running as expected.
