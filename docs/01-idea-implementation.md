# Task Categories and Subtasks

## Overview

This document outlines the task categories and subtasks for implementing a robust, production-ready VPS with optional Kubernetes and Docker, and a fully secure server configuration.

## Task Categories

1. **VPS Setup and Configuration**
   1.1. Secure VPS configuration with minimal services exposed.
   1.2. Firewall setup using UFW.
   1.3. SSH hardening with key-based authentication.
   1.4. Disable root login and password authentication.
   1.5. Configure fail2ban for SSH protection.

2. **Optional Kubernetes Setup**
   2.1. Kubernetes cluster setup with kubeadm.
   2.2. High availability configuration using multiple nodes.
   2.3. Security best practices for Kubernetes (e.g., RBAC, Network Policies).
   2.4. Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus and Grafana.

3. **Optional Docker Setup**
   3.1. Docker installation and configuration.
   3.2. Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
   3.3. Docker security best practices.

4. **Security Hardening**
   4.1. CIS Benchmarks compliance for the VPS.
   4.2. Regular security audits using OpenVAS.
   4.3. Incident response plan with predefined roles.

5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   5.1. Prometheus and Grafana setup for monitoring.
   5.2. ELK Stack implementation for logging.

6. **Backup & Recovery**
   6.1. Regular backups configuration using tools like rsync or restic.
   6.2. Velero setup for Kubernetes backup and recovery.

## Future Enhancements

- Automate security updates and patches using tools like Ansible.
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) using NGINX or AWS WAF.
- Set up a disaster recovery plan with regular drills.
- Enhance monitoring with additional metrics and alerts.
